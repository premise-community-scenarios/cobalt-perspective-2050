Description
-----------

This is a repository containing a scenario that implements the projections of the 
van der Meide et al., 2022 study for:

* cobalt. 

It is meant to be used in `premise` in addition to a global IAM scenario, to provide 
refined projections for the future supply of cobalt on the global market.

This data package contains all the files necessary for `premise` to implement
this scenario and create market-specific composition for cobalt (including supply from recycling channels).

Ecoinvent database compatibility
--------------------------------

ecoinvent 3.8 cut-off

IAM scenario compatibility
---------------------------

The following coupling is done between IAM and the cobalt scenarios:

| IAM scenario           | EP2050+ scenario        |
|------------------------| ------------------------|
| IMAGE SSP2-Base        | Business As Usual       |
| IMAGE SSP2-RCP26       | Sustainable development |

What does this do?
------------------

This external scenario update the ecoinvent global market for cobalt, according
to the projections described in van der Meide et al., 2022.

Cobalt
******

The following market is introduced:

* `market for cobalt (CP2050)` (GLO)

It is supplied by six cobalt production pathways:
* cobalt from cobalt mining
* cobalt as a co-product from copper mining (ore extraction, processing and electrowinning)
* cobalt as a co-product from nickel mining
* cobalt as a co-product from zinc mining
* cobalt recovered from discarded batteries (hydro- and pyro-metallurgical processes)

This market is relinked to activities that consume metallic cobalt throughout the database, if any.

How to use it?
--------------

```python

    import brightway2 as bw
    from premise import NewDatabase
    from datapackage import Package
    
    
    fp = r"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/premise-community-scenarios/cobalt-perspective-2050/main/datapackage.json"
    cobalt2050 = Package(fp)

    external_scenarios = [
        {"scenario": "Business As Usual", "data": cobalt2050},
    ]
    
    bw.projects.set_current("your_bw_project")

    
    ndb = NewDatabase(
            scenarios = [
                {"model":"image", "pathway":"SSP2-Base", "year":2050, "external scenarios": external_scenarios},
                {"model":"image", "pathway":"SSP2-RCP26", "year":2030, "external scenarios": external_scenarios},
            ],

            key='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
        )
        
    ndb.update("external") # or ndb.update() to include the IAM scenario and the external one
```
